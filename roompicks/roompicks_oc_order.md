1\. Definitions

</div>

a.  Single - A two-person room which is occupied by only one person.
b.  Declared Single - single, as above, as the result of a
    previous roompick. Freshmen may not hold declared singles.
c.  N-Person room - a room designed for exactly N people.
d.  N-person Off Campus House - an off campus affiliated building with
    one street address that accomodates N people. This designation will
    apply only during End-of-Year Roompicks. During middle-of-year
    roompicks, such a house will be awarded as N-person rooms according
    to the Housing Office designations. In no case shall the designation
    of N-person house apply for N greater than 4.
e.  Class designation - (FR, SO, JR, SR, SS) as defined below:
    i.  When a student (frosh, transfer or otherwise) becomes a full
        member, they must obtain a class designation; incoming freshmen
        will be assigned "frosh" designation, while transfers and
        returning students must declare their class designation with
        the Secretary. This class designation will be used in
        all RoomPicks.
    ii. Each member's class designation will increment \[ FR SO JR SR SS
        \] automatically and only immediately preceding the
        end-of-year RoomPick.
    iii. Members shall not enter the end-of-year RoomPick with the same
        class designation more than once, with the exception of
        extenuating cases of returning members.

f.  Settler - A person who shall inhabit a room or house in the upcoming
    academic Institute Housing period.
g.  Squatter - A student who most recently inhabited a room or house.
h.  Undeclared Single - a single that arises not as the result of a
    previous roompick but due to one roommate dropping out of the room.
i.  Member (as used in Roompick Rules only) - a previous full member who
    will be a full member in the following term. This includes returning
    students and people who are not currently students but have
    sufficient confidence from the dean(s) of their return as a student
    for the following term (see Article I of the Constitution for how
    these people may reinstate membership).

<div class="bylawheading">

2\. Roompick Order

</div>

a.  The President of Lloyd House shall have the highest
    overall roompick.
b.  SR pick higher than JR who pick higher than SO who pick higher than
    FR who pick higher than SS.
c.  Officers pick at the top of their respective classes in the
    following order: Secretary, Superintendent, Social Director,
    Treasurer, Athletic Manager, BOC Rep.
d.  Card Pick is used to resolve all ties, **except in the case of
    end-of-year roompicks, see (3.g)**. The sequence of cards will be
    announced by the Secretary prior to the drawing of cards.
e.  Health Ad, UCC, and Excomm Privileges and Restrictions
    i.  UCCs whose terms begin at the start of the academic year must
        live in their respective alleys for the duration of their term.
        The President, Secretary, and Superintendent must remain on
        campus or move on-campus at the start of the new academic year.
        If any of the above move off-campus during the course of their
        term, they must relinquish their office at that time. Excomm
        must take appropriate action to fill that vacancy.
    ii. Treasurer, Social Director, and Ath Manager retain their
        roompick ranks and are encouraged to move on-campus if elected
        while living off-campus but may choose to not exercise
        this right. However, Excomm, by a simple majority vote, may
        require any of the above to move on-campus at the first
        opportunity or relinquish their office at that time.
    iii. In order to guarantee that at least two health ads (rising
        juniors or higher) are offered residence on campus each year the
        following lockout protocol shall be in effect at end-of-year
        roompicks: after the seniors have finished picking and the
        number of junior and sophomore rooms (rooms to be picked by a
        junior or sophomore) has been determined (taking into account
        2.e and 3.e.iii), the Secretary will iterate through the
        junior roster. Before each junior pick the Secretary must take
        the following protocol into account: the junior health ad with
        the highest pick must be offered to pick the next room if, when
        filling the designated junior rooms,\
        \
        (\# of junior rooms left to be picked) - (\# of rooms guaranteed
        to junior UCCs who haven't picked yet) + (\# of health ads
        already known to be living on campus next year) + (\# of junior
        UCCs or their roommates who haven't picked yet but are health
        ads),\
        \
        is less than or equal to 2.

<div class="bylawheading">

3\. End-of-Year Roompicks

</div>

a.  End-of-Year Roompicks will occur between three days after the
    postings of the general OC pick order and three days before the
    actual OC picks.
b.  All members entering must notify the Secretary by three days
    prior.
c.  A master list ranking all those who entered roompicks will be posted
    at least two days before roompicks start.
d.  Starting at the top of the list, moving down, eliminating people and
    cycling through the list as many times as is necessary, the person
    whose turn it is to pick may pass, or, if they can produce the
    necessary roommate(s), pick any room of Lloyd housing, on-campus or
    otherwise, subject to the following constraints:
    i.  The first time through the list only non-doubles can be chosen.
        N-person off campus houses may be selected by N people as
        a whole. If no group of N people wishes to select the house
        together, the house shall be broken up into N-person rooms as
        designated by the Housing Office. If affiliated Off-Campus
        spaces remain open after On-Campus has filled, then Off-Campus
        picks will resume with the first person who had not yet had an
        opportunity to pick after On-Campus filled.
    ii. Between the first and second times through the list, UCC's and
        others who are guaranteed a spot on campus must declare
        their roommates. See (2.e).
    iii. During the second time through the list, after the number of
        Juniors on-campus, anticipating those from (ii), exceeds
        two-thirds (rounded down) of the non-SR, non-SS,
        non-reserved-for-FR, non-reserved-for-guaranteed-Excomm people
        spots on campus, until the list is cycled through again, no
        Junior, except from (ii), may use their pick to pick on campus.
    iv. The incoming UCC committee may set limits on the number of new
        students and upperclassmen living in each alley prior to
        the roompick. If it fails to set such limits, there shall be no
        restrictions placed on the number of upperclassmen and new
        students required to live in each alley.
    v.  At their turn to pick, anyone may declare a "Frosh" as a
        roommate, subject to the following constraints:
        a.  When picking a "Frosh" as a roommate, you may be forced to
            enter Beginning-of-the-Year Roompicks.
        b.  If after the last on-campus room has been picked, the parity
            of declared "Frosh" Roommates does not equal the parity of
            the expected number of FR, the last person to declare a
            "Frosh" roommate will not be allowed to do so, and must find
            a Upperclassman roommate, use his pick to pick off campus,
            or pass (giving up his room).
        c.  At most one person may declare a "Frosh" roommate, and only
            in cases when parity is odd. This person will pick after
            SuperSeniors in the roompick order.

    vi. Before each Pick, a check will be made both to check alley
        lockouts and to ensure that there are enough rooms available for
        those guaranteed a room in (2.e). Once there are just enough
        rooms remaining for those guaranteed a room in (2.e), then the
        pick will continue down the list, allowing only those mentioned
        in (2.e) to pick rooms this time through the list.

e.  The Secretary will record an ordered list of the
    End-of-Year Roompicks. This list will be saved by the Secretary
    until the end of the ensuing Rotation.
f.  Changes during the Summer
    i.  For changes that occur before the Beginning-of-Year Roompick,
        the picking order is the same as it was for the
        end-of-year roompick.
    ii. If an undeclared single is created during the summer, the
        occupant of the room must accept any available roommate or the
        room will be entered into roompicks at this time.
    iii. If a room is completely vacated or the expected number of FR
        decreases by two or more, the subsequent vacancies are entered
        into roompick.
    iv. If the change in the expected number of FR decrease by an odd
        amount, then if there are still declared "Frosh" roommates, the
        last person to have picked such must accept any available
        roommate or they (and a room) will be entered into roompicks at
        this time.
    v.  The roompick shall proceed as in D above with all the
        restrictions applying.

g.  Ties in pick order will be broken using the Caltech off-campus
    lottery picks, in reverse order, always deferring to the most
    up-to-date version in case of corrections or additions. Cases where
    a Lloydie cannot obtain a lottery pick will be resolved according to
    the Secretary's discretion.

<div class="bylawheading">

4\. Beginning-of-the-Year Roompicks

</div>

a.  All Freshmen picked into the House and all Upperclassmen with
    "Frosh" roommates are entered into this roompick and must draw
    a card. No other upperclassman may enter these roompicks except in
    the case of unanticipated vacancies in Lloyd Housing.
b.  Procedure
    i.  The Secretary will compose and post a master list of
        picking order.
    ii. Starting from the top of the list and working down until all
        spots are chosen, the person whose pick it is may pass and be
        moved to the bottom of the list, or, if they can produce a
        roommate, pick a room.
    iii. If all the remaining people on the list have already passed,
        they may be forced to room together.

<div class="bylawheading">

5\. Summer Roompicks

</div>

a.  Rules for Summer roompicks shall be listed in descending priority.
    In the event that a conflict occurs among summer roompick rules, the
    Secretary shall make a ruling which is consistent with
    Institute requirements.
b.  The Secretary shall ensure a sufficient number of non-freshman rooms
    is available for summer storage.
c.  A pair which consists of at least one settler shall have priority
    over a pair which consists of at least one squatter, both of which
    have priority over other pairs or singles.
d.  Rules 2a through 2d shall govern the order of roompicks with the
    addition that recently graduated seniors shall pick higher than
    rising seniors.

<div class="bylawheading">

6\. Other Roompicks

</div>

a.  Roompicks will be held within two weeks of the beginning of every
    term as well as within two weeks of the opening of a vacancy in
    Lloyd Housing or Lloyd-affiliated housing. The Secretary will inform
    the House members of the available spots within the House and
    off-campus affiliated housing.
b.  All members wishing to enter roompicks must inform the Secretary at
    least one day prior to the roompick.
c.  All members entering the roompick retain squatter's rights to their
    current room, so long as they have a roommate, but the room is
    entered into the roompick.
d.  All members living in undeclared singles must accept any available
    or enter roompicks.
e.  If the number of people entering picks is less than the number of
    spots available, the appropriate number of singles will be created.
    Procedure:
    i.  The Secretary will compose and post a master list of
        picking order.
    ii. Starting from the top of the list and working down until all
        spots are chosen, the person whose pick it is may pass or, if
        they can produce the necessary roommate(s), pick a room.
        Alternatively, if the number of available spaces exceed the
        number of people who have not yet picked, then the person may
        pick a room alone.

f.  Roommate swaps and/or room swaps may occur at any time, at the
    request of all participants, without a roompick; with the approval
    of the Secretary.
g.  If, at the time of a roompick there are people holding declared
    singles and the number of people that wish to move on campus as
    doubles is greater than the number of vacancies due to undeclared
    singles and/or unoccupied rooms, then some of the peopl e holding
    declared singles prior to the roompicks may have them "undeclared"
    subject to the following conditions.
    i.  If only one individual of a particular gender holds a single
        prior to a roompick, and that single is a declared single, then
        that single can not be undeclared as a result of that roompick.
        The holder of the single need not enter the roompick.
    ii. All other holders of declared singles must enter the roompick.
    iii. The single with the lowest pick and the single of the same
        gender with the next lowest pick each have the opportunity to
        find a roommate and exercise squatter's rights with their
        current room. Should neither of them do this, these two
        individuals shall room together and a double shall be brought
        on campus. If one of these individuals finds a roommate, he/she
        leaves the roompick and this process is repeated as necessary.
        If at any point there is only one single remaining of a given
        gender, that single remains declared and is removed from
        the roompick.
    iv. If singles are forced to pair together, they may exercise
        squatter's rights with the room either single occupied before
        the roompicks, or they may pick from the available rooms in the
        roompick at their turn to pick.
    v.  No person shall lose a declared single in order to give someone
        else a declared single, nor shall any singles be undeclared in a
        roompick that results in new singles being declared.
    vi. No individual shall be forced off-campus as a result of their
        single becoming undeclared unless they are unwilling to find or
        accept a roommate.

<div class="bylawheading">

7\. Alley Loss

</div>

a.  If for any reason Lloyd must give up an on-campus alley, the alley
    to be lost will be selected by some random procedure performed by
    the President.
b.  Once an alley has been lost, vacancies will be created by reclaiming
    the rooms selected last from the previous End-of-Year Roompicks,
    using the list created by the Secretary. The number of vacancies
    created in this manner will match the number of rooms in the lost
    alley that were not reserved for Freshmen. The vacancies that are
    created outside of the lost alley will be entered into a special
    Roompick in which members of the lost alley get top priority in
    order of their picks from the Secretary's list, followed by those
    who were vacated as part of this process.
c.  If an off-campus alley is lost, the lockout barrier for each alley
    is decreased by one from the barriers set at the previous
    End-of-Year Roompicks, and the members of the off-campus alley are
    entered into an exclusive Roompicks for the newly available rooms.
d.  If extra Freshmen exceeding the number of Frosh rooms are assigned
    to Lloyd, create rooms for them starting with the last pick from the
    Secretary's list from the previous Roompicks and proceeding as high
    up the list as necessary.

<div class="bylawheading">
